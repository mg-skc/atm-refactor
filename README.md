# atm refactor 
For the Final lab you will be creating a refactoring and expanding the ATM program.

* In lab 3 we wrote a program that behaves like an ATM that you can interact with. It was able to:

    * Access a bank account with a pin

    * Create a new bank account with a unique pin

    * Deposit money into the bank account and print the new balance

    * Withdraw money from the bank account and print the new balance

    * Get the balance of the bank account

* For the new lab start by adding the following features: 

    * Change the pin of the bank account (If the pin is in use, don't change it and alert the user that it's taken). 
	* Display the date and time on all pages
	* Display a warning about fees that must be confirmed before withdrawing or depositing money 

* Refactor the following code: 
	
	* Convert the constructor functions into classes

* Additionally: 
	
	* Error check the users input. Fulfill the following requirements in doing so: 
		* Pins can only be 4 numbers and no other characters are allowed. 
		* Withdrawal and deposit amounts must be increments of $20 with a limit of $200 and must be numbers.
		
	* Update the html and css to style the elements and make them pleasing to the eye 
	* Comment each block of code and explain what it does. 

* Push your code to your repository.
